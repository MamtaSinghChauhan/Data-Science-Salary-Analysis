# Data Science Salaries Analysis & Prediction

Welcome to my first data science project — an end-to-end analysis of the [ds_salaries dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries). This project explores salary trends in the data science domain and builds a machine learning model to predict salary based on key features such as job title, experience level, company size, and location.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project was designed to:
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the `ds_salaries` dataset
- Uncover key trends by **job title, experience, employment type, and country**
- **Preprocess data** using encoding and outlier removal
- Build a **machine learning regression model** to predict salaries
- Evaluate model performance using visualization and metrics

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualizations created include:

- 📌 **Top Paying Job Titles**
- 🌍 **Top 10 Countries by Average Salary**
- 📈 **Average Salary by Experience Level**
- 🏢 **Salary by Employment Type**
- 🧾 **Boxplots for Outlier Detection**
- 📊 **Correlation Heatmap**

All charts are styled with dark themes and sorted logically for readability.

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing

Steps taken:

- Label encoding for categorical features  
- Outlier detection and removal using IQR method  
- Splitting into train and test sets  

---

## 🤖 Model Building

Two regression models were evaluated:

- **Random Forest Regressor**

**Metrics Used:**
- R² Score
- Mean_Absolute_Error
- Mean_Squared_Error
- True vs Predicted scatter plots for both training and testing data  

---

## 📌 Results

- Achieved strong prediction alignment on both training and test sets  
- Visuals clearly revealed salary trends and disparities across roles and regions
